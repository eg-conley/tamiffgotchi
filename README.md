## Introduction

A simple web application based on Japanese Tamagotchi pets. This is a personal project with no intent of publishing for financial gain. Its primary means is a way to develop design and front end development sklls: Check out my initial designs on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/OwHOUt15U9Yn0RdgNjNptw/tamiffgotchi?node-id=0-1&t=cONElHMdeHCFjRKJ-1)!

## Features

- Feed, play with, and clean your pet! Their health depends on you, so don't leave them hanging for too long or else they might die.
- Journey through your pet's life stages. See them develop from a baby all the way to their elder years.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

List the tools and dependencies required to run the project.

- This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.0.0. For more information on using the Angular CLI, including detailed command references, visit the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) page.
- Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

### Installation

Step-by-step guide to set up the project locally.

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Usage

### Development Server

Instructions to start the development server.

### Building the Project

Steps to build the project for production.

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

### Running Tests

How to execute unit and end-to-end tests.

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
